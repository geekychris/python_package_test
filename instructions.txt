I want to understand how to make and deploy a python package that I can use pip install to install that package.  Create me a simple python package that provides a basic calculator function.  Include scripts and instructions on how to build this package.  The package should be installable by accessing it from a git repository.  I dont know if that requires git workflows to automatically build and release, but if so make the workflow scripts too.
